`metz/swaggerui` is a Docker image for the [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/), that supports publishing [Swagger Specs](https://swagger.io/specification/) via **API** and **volume mount**.

## Getting started

You can pull and run a pre-built Docker image directly from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/metz/swaggerui/):

```sh
docker run --name swaggerui -p 80:8080 hajnalmt/swaggerui
```

This will start the Swagger UI using the default [petstore JSON](http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json). Then you can access the Swagger UI directly from a browser:

- **Swagger UI:** [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost/)

### Publish a custom Swagger Spec

In order to supply your own Swagger Spec (`swagger.json`), you will need to either publish it via the **API** or mount it with a **volume**.

Both solutions can be combined, so that the currently published Swagger Spec will be synced with the mounted directory.

#### API

> For more details about the API, see the [API overview](#api-reference).

A new Swagger Spec can be published by sending a `POST` request with the Swagger JSON in the body to the `/publish` endpoint:

```sh
curl -v -X POST \
	-d @swagger_upload.json \
	-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
	http://localhost:80/publish
```

#### Volume

In order to publish the Swagger Spec via filesystem, mount the directory containing the `swagger.json` as a volume at `/swaggerui/swagger`:

```sh
docker run --name swaggerui -p 80:8080 -v /path/to/spec:/swaggerui/swagger hajnalmt/swaggerui
```

##### Persistence

Mounting the volume also preserves the Swagger Spec across container shutdown and startup.

## Developing
